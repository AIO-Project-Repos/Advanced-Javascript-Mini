// First Principle
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
  console.log(this);
}

// Second Principle
const myObj = {
  hi: 'Hello ',
  sayHi: function(name) {
    console.log(this.hi + name);
    console.log(this);
  }
};

myObj.sayHi('Ryan');

// Third Principle
function CordialPerson(greeter) {
  this.greeting = 'Hello ';
  this.greeter = greeter;
  this.speak = function() {
    console.log(this.greeting + this.greeter);
    console.log(this);
  };
}

const jerry = new CordialPerson('Newman');
var newman = new CordialPerson('Jerry');

jerry.speak();
newman.speak();

// Fourth Principle * you may want to use your third rule's example to accomplish this
