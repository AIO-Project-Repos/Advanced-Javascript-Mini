// constructor functions:

// create a constructor function called "Car"
// car takes an options object as its only argument
// your options object should have "make", "model", "year" properties on it
// assign these properties you pass in with options to the constructors 'this' object.
// add a speak() method to your object that when called will log out the car's make model and year.

// when you're done un comment the next few lines and run the file here in node `node app.js`.

// const herby = new Car({make: 'Volkswagen', model: 'Beetle', year: '1963'});
// console.log(herby.speak());
// const goldfinger = new Car({make: 'Aston Martin', model: 'DB5', year: '1964'});
// console.log(goldfinger.speak());

// once you get done with this, redo it all using the class keyword and a constructor function.
